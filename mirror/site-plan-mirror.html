        My Mirror reflects on professional technical skills that I have and what I've been able 
        to achieve with them. Future project partners and employers will need to know where I fit
        in their organisation and what I can do for them. Here is a portfolio that helps them figure that out very quickly and maybe        
        even decide if I'm a good hire.
        There are two sections, one focused on my relevant technical skills in Software Engineering and the 
        other is about what I've done in that field.

        <br><br>
        1. Technical Skills:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>What the skill is.</li>
          <li>How I developed the skill (Self-taught, Bootcamp or University?)</li>
          <li>Proficiency level: For how long have I practised it and how comfortable do I feel with conducting projects using that skill.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        2. Achievements:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Explanation of the project: Purpose and impact of the project.</li>
          <li>How long it took to build it and the challenges invloved.</li>
          <li>What I learnt and gained during that time: networks, more skills.</li>
          
        </ul>

      <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
      <p>

         <li>A detailed description of programming languages that I am proficient in. It includes two major divisions:<br>
            Front-end languages and Back-end languages.</li>
          <li>Complementary skills in Cloud DevOps: This includes being a certified practitiober of platforms like Amazon
            Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
          </li>
          <li>
            How did I build each skill? Self Taught (length of time), Bootcamp or University?
          </li>

      <h3>Achievements</h3>
      <p>
        A list of projects that I've undertaken, individually or with a team.
        <br>
        For each achievement section, the following questions will be answered:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Project description: Problem it is solving and how it does that.</li><br>
          <li>Challenges that I faced and specific things that I did to overcome them.</li><br>
          <li>Project Timeline: How long it took from inception to launching.</li><br>
          <li>Results of the project: impact in society and how it impacted me as well. What did I learn and gain from the experience?</li><br>
          <li>Status of the project: Is it dead or alive and why?</li><br>
